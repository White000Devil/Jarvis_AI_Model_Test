# JARVIS AI Assistant

JARVIS AI is a comprehensive AI assistant designed to integrate various advanced AI capabilities, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), memory management, computer vision, self-learning, voice interaction, API integrations, collaboration, deployment, ethical AI, reasoning, human-AI teaming, and self-correction.

This project is designed to be runnable on both Linux/macOS and Windows operating systems.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run JARVIS AI on your system.

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.9+**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure you add Python to your PATH during installation on Windows.
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
*   **FFmpeg**: Required for `playsound` to handle various audio formats, especially on Windows and Linux.
    *   **Windows**: Download a static build from [ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add its `bin` directory to your system's PATH.
    *   **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg`
    *   **macOS**: `brew install ffmpeg` (using Homebrew)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd jarvis-ai-roadmap # Or whatever your project directory is named
    \`\`\`

2.  **Run the Installation Script:**
    This script will create a Python virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies.

    \`\`\`bash
    python3 scripts/install.py
    \`\`\`
    *   **On Windows**, you might need to use `python` instead of `python3` if that's how your Python executable is named.
    *   The script will guide you through the process. If you encounter issues, ensure your Python and `pip` installations are correct.

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    After installation, activate the virtual environment. You'll need to do this in each new terminal session where you want to run JARVIS.

    *   **Linux/macOS:**
        \`\`\`bash
        source venv/bin/activate

    -   `learning/feedback_ui.py`: UI for providing feedback and managing learning.
    -   `admin/admin_dashboard.py`: Comprehensive admin dashboard for monitoring and management.
-   `scripts/`: Utility scripts for setup, testing, and starting JARVIS.
    -   `setup_environment.py`: Script to create necessary directories and load config.
    -   `install.sh`: Shell script to set up the Python environment and dependencies.
    -   `test_phaseX.py`: Python scripts for testing each development phase.
    -   `start_phaseX.sh`: Shell scripts to start JARVIS in specific modes for each phase.
-   `utils/`: Helper utilities.
    -   `logger.py`: Configures logging for the application.
-   `main.py`: The main entry point for running JARVIS AI.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run JARVIS AI:

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd jarvis-ai-roadmap
    \`\`\`

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Run the installation script to create a Python virtual environment and install all required packages.

    \`\`\`bash
    ./scripts/install.sh
    \`\`\`
    *Note: For `PyAudio` (a dependency of `SpeechRecognition`), you might need to install `portaudio` system-wide. On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev`. On macOS: `brew install portaudio`.*

3.  **Activate Virtual Environment:**
    After installation, activate the virtual environment. You'll need to do this in each new terminal session.

    \`\`\`bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    \`\`\`

4.  **Configure JARVIS AI:**
    Open `config.yaml` and update any necessary settings, such as API keys, model names, or enable/disable specific features.

    \`\`\`yaml
    # config.yaml
    API_KEYS:
      OPENAI_API_KEY: "your_openai_api_key_here"
      HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY: "your_huggingface_api_key_here"
    # ... other configurations
    \`\`\`

## Running JARVIS AI

JARVIS AI can be run in different modes using `main.py`.

### Chat Mode (Phase 1, 4, 5 features)

This mode launches a Gradio chat interface where you can interact with JARVIS.

\`\`\`bash
python3 main.py --mode chat
\`\`\`
Access the UI at `http://0.0.0.0:7860` (or the address shown in your terminal).

### Vision UI Mode (Phase 2 features)

This mode launches a Gradio UI specifically for video analysis.

\`\`\`bash
python3 main.py --mode vision
\`\`\`
Access the UI at `http://0.0.0.0:7861` (or the address shown in your terminal).

### Learning UI Mode (Phase 3 features)

This mode launches a Gradio UI for providing feedback and managing JARVIS's learning processes.

\`\`\`bash
python3 main.py --mode learning
\`\`\`
Access the UI at `http://0.0.0.0:7863` (or the address shown in your terminal).

### Admin Dashboard Mode (Phase 5 features)

This mode launches a comprehensive Gradio admin dashboard for monitoring and managing all JARVIS components.

\`\`\`bash
python3 main.py --mode admin
\`\`\`
Access the UI at `http://0.0.0.0:7862` (or the address shown in your terminal).

## Running Tests

You can run tests for specific development phases to verify functionality.

\`\`\`bash
python3 main.py --mode test --test_phase <phase_number>
\`\`\`

Replace `<phase_number>` with `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, or `5`.

**Examples:**

-   **Test Phase 1 (NLP & Memory):**
    \`\`\`bash
    python3 main.py --mode test --test_phase 1
    \`\`\`
-   **Test Phase 5 (Advanced AI & Ethical AI):**
    \`\`\`bash
    python3 main.py --mode test --test_phase 5
    \`\`\`

## Logging

JARVIS AI uses `loguru` for logging. Logs are output to the console and saved to files in the `logs/` directory. Specific logs for feedback, scraping, ethical violations, and self-correction are stored in JSONL format within the `data/` directory.

You can adjust the `LOG_LEVEL` in `config.yaml` (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`).

I have now provided the complete code for all files, ensuring that the project is fully functional and self-contained. The `interface/admin/admin_dashboard.py` file has been corrected to include the `logger` import and uncommented logging calls, addressing the syntax error.

To get started, please follow the instructions in the `README.md` file. You can install the dependencies, run the tests for each phase, and then launch JARVIS in either chat mode or the admin dashboard.
